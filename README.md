#EyeSafe

## Inspiration

As someone with an elderly grandmother, I was concerned that she wouldn't be safe. If she were to answer door, and someone with bad intentions was to just push past her, there'd be nothing she could do. That's why we developed EyeSafe, a system that uses facial recognition to tell you who's at the door before things can go wrong.

## What it does

What EyeSafe does is monitors your door, sending you notifications when someone is at your door. These notifications are available both visually, and audibly, so that more people could benefit from our product.

## How we built it

EyeSafe is built using JavaScript on a Node.js server. It uses the Microsoft Cognitive API for facial comparision, and React.js for the web application. 

## Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge we ran into was finding an image hosting API to handle our massive amount of photos

## Accomplishments that we are proud of

We were able to create our own image hosting API, and we were also proud of our vocal and visual notifications.

## What's next for EyeSafe

We are hoping to integrate motion and develop a phone application. We are also hoping to bring these cameras to more than just the front door, and to include better facial identification, similar to Facebook's tagging system.
